# City Explorer

This was an assignment in the [Udacity Front End Nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1) Module 5

I altered the scope of the project and tried to make a much more dynamic and exciting experience, and although I actually didn't finish it, it is kind of fun to search around for cities  and look at pictures of popular spots.

The project uses the foursquare api and the google maps api.

Eventually I got bored of all the spaghetti I was making with my code, but I had a good time learning how to make requests to third-party apis and I found google maps especially interesting.

Search for a city, remember to click the markers!
